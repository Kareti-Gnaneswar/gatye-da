# Back Story
This directory consists of python programming problems on Regression. The problems where originally formulate for EE 405:Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning course at IIT Dharwad by [Prof. S.R.Mahadeva Prasanna](https://sites.google.com/iitdh.ac.in/prasanna/home) and his TAs. [Swakath](https://github.com/swakath) the original author of this repository attended this course.

# What is what
We have two IPYNB file in this directory. IPYNB file is an Intractive python notebook file. More about IPYNB here. 

- [Regression_Unsolved.ipynb](/Data/Machine-Learning/python-practice-problems/regression/Regression_Unsolved.ipynb) file containing short programming problems on regression.  
- [Regression_Solutions.ipynb](/Data/Machine-Learning/python-practice-problems/regression/Regression_Solutions.ipynb) file contains [swakath's](https://github.com/swakath) solution for the problems.

You can use [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) for running these file, it is free you just need google account to access it.  
[salary_pred_data1.csv](/Data/Machine-Learning/python-practice-problems/regression/salary_pred_data1.csv) is a Comma-seperated values file, it contains a salary data set which we will be used as input for the last problem in the IPYNB file. You can upload this file to you google drive and access it in google colab. ([Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc8g8lGcwQU))


# Prerequisite
- Before starting with this problem you are expected to have basic understanding on regression and math behind it. You can learn it from our beloved [Andrew Ng](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6jyaRrk973TCX3TfnOZIGx5VZVJHvvBE)

- Basic python programming knowledge. What is basic? If you know funtions and basic data structs it is great :)

- Programming knowledge should not be a barrier to start with this assignment. Just start and learn things on the way. You can always use the solution to learn syntax and libraries.
